# [Aditya Sankar | Homepage](http://www.adityasankar.com/)

This is the source code for my homepage, which also happens to be hosted on github.io. The template I have built upon is [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/), which is a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

## Overview

I have utilized the following frameworks and templates:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/), created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/)
* [BlueImp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery)

You may adapt the template to your own needs by:
* Downloading the latest release
* Forking this repository on GitHub
